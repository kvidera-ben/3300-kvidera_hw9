Description:

This project was creating a web form survey for the department of business analytics at Uiowa. Content covers home country, city, year of undergrad, classes taken, and level of happiness with the major.



Conforming to best practices: 

To ensure the web form comformed to best practices, I have implemented several measures. I created a user friendly design, with only a few sections per page so it is intuitive to use. I added boostrap and CSS styling for aesthetics and made the app responsive to different screen sizes. HTML validation was used to prevent users from missing certain sections, thus ensuring all required data is collected. 

Along with the html verifications, I also ensured CSS validation for the page. I added tooltips to sections for clarification on requested information. This was also paired with a font awesome icon so the user knows where to go for the tool tip. These additional modifications help make the app intuitive to use. 



User Accessibility: 

For user accessibility, each page of the web form has been modified to meet Level AA compliance. Proper HTML elements such as <label> are used to associate fields. Bootstrap utilizes ARIA for enhanced user interaction. Additionally, form is navigable on both desktop and mobile.
